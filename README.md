# log_reg
A simple implementation of Logistic regression.
Here the model uses logistic regression for data to find the probability of finding the wolf spider on the beaches of Japan,
depending on the size of the sand grain in those beaches.
Here the data has only one feature. But the same code can be tweaked to accomodate 'n' features.
